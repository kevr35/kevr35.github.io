    We perform a thorough investigation of the first Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) recurrence in the $\beta$-FPUT chain for both positive and negative $\beta$. We show numerically that the rescaled FPUT recurrence time $T_r=t_r/(N+1)^3$ depends, for large N, only on the parameter $S\equiv E\beta(N+1)$. Our numerics also reveal that for small $|S|$, $T_r$ is linear in $S$ with positive slope for both positive and negative $\beta$. For large $|S|$, $T_r$ is proportional to $|S|^{-1/2}$ for both positive and negative $\beta$ but with different multiplicative constants. We numerically study the continuum limit and find that the recurrence time closely follows the $|S|^{-1/2}$ scaling and can be interpreted in terms of solitons, as in the case of the KdV equation for the $\alpha$ chain. The difference in the multiplicative factors between positive and negative $\beta$ arises from soliton-kink interactions that exist only in the negative $\beta$ case. We complement our numerical results with analytical considerations in the nearly linear regime (small $|S|$) and in the highly nonlinear regime (large $|S|$). For the former, we extend previous results using a shifted-frequency perturbation theory and find a closed form for $T_r$ that depends only on S. In the latter regime, we show that $T_r\propto|S|^{-1/2}$ is predicted by the soliton theory in the continuum limit. We then investigate the existence of the FPUT recurrences and show that their disappearance surprisingly depends only on $E\beta$ for large $N$, not $S$. Finally, we end by discussing the striking differences in the amount of energy mixing between positive and negative $\beta$ and offer some remarks on the thermodynamic limit.
